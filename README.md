# [revealify](https://meew0.github.io/revealify/)

An extremely simple tool that turns plain text into a barebones ad-hoc reveal.js presentation, with one slide for each line in the original text. The text can either be input directly or loaded from a specified URL.

This can be used for any sort of purpose where text needs to be displayed one line at a time, with the ability to go forward/backward and jump around. I made it in order to read translated visual novel scripts alongside the original, but I suppose it could be used for a variety of other purposes as well. Let me know if you have any other creative use for this! (And especially, let me know if you use this to hold an actual presentation)
